# DataStructures
Project 4 compares the sorting algorithms insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quicksort, and heap sort. The algorithms are timed in seconds, and have the amount of data comparisons and data exchanges counted. The program also has an optional command line argument --dump to instruct the program to print the sorted array or not.
